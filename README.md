## How can I make this work?

You'll need an IBM Cloud account with the following Watson services:

* Assistant
* Speech-to-Text
* Text-to-Speech

Use the username, password, and URL for each service in the Unity editor (avatar GameObject with script component). Assistant requires a workspace id as well.

Upload the .json file into Watson Assistant to use the intents, entities, and dialog.
